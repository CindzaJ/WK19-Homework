# WK19-Homework - Progressive Web Application (PWA) Text Editor

The purose of this week's Homework intends to apply our relevant knowledge of what we had learned on Progressive Web Application (PWA) by using a Text editor by extracting and sorting our existing IndexDB database with our provided starter code as given. 

During the further development of this Project of applucing IndexDB, we were able to not only apply create to store Data, but also to be able to automatically generate the <strong>'manifest.json' file</strong> by using the `WebpackPwaManifest` plug-in as a bundled Webpack. 

Further, by successfully applying the context of PWA, it allows us to test the functionality of the TextEditor that can be installed without the availability of the Internet, just so our Users can still view the final outcome with a Mock-trial UI experience. 
This Project will be submitted with both a deployed URL application along with URL GitHub Repository as shown.  

Finally, we sincerely hope that our Users will be able to enjoy viewing this Project outcome as much as we did in creating them.
